  <p>
    I am a researcher at the <a href="https://ml.postech.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Lab (ML Lab)</a>, POSTECH, advised by <a href="https://dongwookim-ml.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Dongwoo Kim</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests center on <strong>humanâ€“AI collaboration</strong>, <strong>personalization of large language models (LLMs)</strong>, and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>.
    I explore how people can more effectively interact with AI systems through feedback, developing methods that make models easier to guide and more efficient to refine.
    I also work on building personalized LLMs that adapt to diverse user preferences, designing frameworks that generalize even to unseen users.
    Ultimately, my goal is to create AI assistants that are not only powerful, but also reliable, adaptable, and aligned with individual needs.
